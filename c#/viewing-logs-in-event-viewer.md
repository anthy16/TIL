# Viewing Logs in Event Viewer

While debugging locally in a .NET application, logs can, by default, be found in Event Viewer.

Logs for a local application can be found at `Event Viewer -> Windows Logs -> Application`.

This page shows a list of logs. There are several categories, such as:

- Information
- Warning
- Error

Details for a given log can be found by clicking on it. This makes a tab underneath the list appear, which shows the stacktrace/warning/information.
